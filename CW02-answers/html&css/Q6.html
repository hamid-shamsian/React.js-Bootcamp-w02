      <h1>Differences between ID and class in css:</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>An ID for an element should be unique thruoghout the whole of the document. while class is for multiple use for more that one element.</li>
         <li>ID selector in css is prefixed by hash(#) but class selector is prefixed by dot(.)</li>
         <li>
            Another difference is that ID specificity is higher. I mean when we have same css declarations for an element one using ID selector and another using class selector, the style assigned
            using ID will be applied to the element.
         </li>
         <li>
            And the usage difference is that class is technically for giving styles to elements using css but in most cases ID is not for styling but for selecting an element by javascript code to
            manipulate or monitor that element and also giving some relevance between elements in html for example make a label element related to a form input element.
         </li>
      </ul>
