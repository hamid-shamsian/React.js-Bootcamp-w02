            ~ or General sibling combinator is placed between two selectors and will match all the occerences of second element that are following the first element (even if they dont appear
            immediately after the first element) and are children of a same parent element.
            <p>for example: (p ~ a) will select all anchor elements that are following a paragraph elemnt in a same parent element.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            &gt; or Child combinator also separates two selectors and will match all the elements the second selector points to that are only the direct child of first selector.
            <p>for example: (p > a) will select all anchor elements that are direct children of paragraph elemnt</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
